Dependencies
List the main dependencies used in your project, along with their purpose.

React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing application data.
here's a general workflow from the frontend in React to the backend with the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:

Frontend Development with React:

Start by developing the frontend of your application using React. This involves creating components, managing state, handling user interactions, and designing the user interface.
Use tools like create-react-app to bootstrap your React project and manage dependencies efficiently.
Implement routing using React Router to navigate between different views/pages of your application.
Connect to external APIs or backend services as needed for data retrieval or sending requests.
Backend Development with Node.js and Express:

Set up a backend server using Node.js and Express.js. Express is a popular web framework for building server-side applications with Node.js.
Define routes to handle various HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) from the frontend. These routes will serve as endpoints for interacting with your application's data and business logic.
Implement controllers to handle the business logic of your application. Controllers are responsible for processing incoming requests, interacting with models, and sending back appropriate responses.
Use middleware to add additional functionality to your routes, such as authentication, logging, error handling, etc.
Connect your backend to a database (such as MongoDB) using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like Mongoose. Define models to represent your data schema and interact with the database.
MVC Architecture:

Organize your backend codebase following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture:
Model: Represents the data and business logic of your application. Models interact with the database and encapsulate data manipulation operations.
View: Represents the presentation layer of your application. In a RESTful API context, the view can be considered as the JSON responses returned by your API routes.
Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and view. Controllers receive requests from the frontend, process them using the appropriate models, and return responses to the client.
Communication between Frontend and Backend:

Use HTTP requests (e.g., Fetch API, Axios) from your React components to communicate with the backend API endpoints.
Send requests to the corresponding backend routes based on the desired action (e.g., fetching data, submitting a form, updating resources).
Handle responses from the backend in your React components and update the UI accordingly.
Implement error handling to deal with potential issues such as network errors, server errors, or validation failures.
